        <br>
        The term Web3 has become a buzzword in recent years, symbolizing a new era of the internet that is decentralized, user-controlled, and powered by blockchain technology. In this chapter, we will explore what Web3 is, why it matters, and how you can start engaging with the Web3 ecosystem.

        <br><br>
        <div class="h5">What Is Web3?</div>
        Web3 (short for Web 3.0) refers to the next generation of the internet, where decentralized networks and blockchain technologies enable a more open, secure, and user-centered experience. Unlike the current web (Web2), which is dominated by large corporations and centralized services, Web3 promises to give power back to users by allowing them to control their own data, assets, and online interactions.

        <br><br>
        <div class="h5">The Evolution of the Web</div>
        Before we dive deeper into Web3, let’s take a look at how the web has evolved:

        <div>1. Web1 (Read-Only)</div>
        The original web (1990s) was mostly static and read-only. Websites were like digital brochures, and users could only consume content with little to no interaction.
        Examples: Static websites, early blogs.

        <br><br>
        <div>2. Web2 (Read-Write)</div>
        The current web (2000s–present) is more dynamic and interactive. Social media platforms, e-commerce websites, and web apps allow users to create, share, and interact with content. However, most of the web is controlled by a few large companies (e.g., Google, Facebook).
        Examples: Facebook, YouTube, Amazon.

        <br><br>
        <div>3. Web3 (Read-Write-Own)</div>
        Web3 introduces the concept of ownership. Users can not only create and interact with content, but also own digital assets (like cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and data) directly without relying on third parties. This is made possible through blockchain, decentralized networks, and cryptographic tokens.
        Examples: Decentralized apps (dApps), cryptocurrencies, NFTs.

        <div class="h4 text-success">Key principles of Web3</div>
        Web3 is built around a few key principles that distinguish it from the centralized Web2 world:

        <br><br>
        1. Decentralization: No single entity (like a company or government) controls the entire system. Instead, decentralized networks and protocols (like Ethereum or IPFS) allow users to interact directly.

        <br><br>
        2. Ownership: Web3 enables users to truly own digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other tokens, without needing intermediaries like banks or tech companies.

        <br><br>
        3. Tokenization: Web3 is driven by tokens. Tokens can represent digital currency (like ETH or BTC), ownership of an asset (like an NFT), or governance rights within a decentralized organization.

        <br><br>
        4. Trustless: Users don’t need to trust a central authority; smart contracts, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms ensure transactions are secure and fair.

        <br><br>
        5. Open and Permissionless: Anyone with an internet connection can participate in Web3 applications and interact with decentralized networks without needing permission from a central authority.
